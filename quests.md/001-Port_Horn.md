## Port Horn
A small port town near the border of Omahore and Pirea. Last shipping port along the eastern coast before Nofuin Forest. Lots of lumber from Pirea shipped out of the port, as well as fish from the northern villages near Nofuin. Port Horn is currently suffering from an outbreak of Pixie Blisters.

### The Docks
Stinks of fish and wet sawdust, filled with less-than-trustworthy crewmen and merchants. Good place to find another boat out of town, but other countries might be less forgiving of undocumented travelers during these rough times. Overseen. by Gibson the fox.

## The Forest
The forest around Port Horn is dense, reminiscent of Nofuin. There are hunters and lumberfolk around, but its mostly untamed. A single road passes along the border of the forest, heading to the next town.

### Alchemist's Cabin
Cyprus lives in a small shack on a hillside. In his storage room are failed attempts at creating an endless wine barrel, the contents of which are leaking down the hillside and into the river. Cyprus knows he's guilty but wants desperately to avoid punishment for his negligence.
