# Wedding Day
The night before the wedding, Mellen has a dream about a hare. It is running along a path and it comes up to a bramble blocking the path. The hare inspects the bramble, finds an opening, prepares itself, and rushes for the opening. It's head becomes caught in the small opening and it begins kicking it's feet, struggling as it forces it's body through the hole in the bramble, and after great effort it manages to break free on the other side and prance away, leaving the bramble behind in tatters.
