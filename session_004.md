Mellen was brought to the castle in Doseovia and gifted to the eldest son of the Emperor, Commander Shubat. Shubat doesn't want to marry her because he is in love with someone else and Mellen was given a bath and sent to bed by Pesmosia. While in bed, Mellen has a dream, thanks to the goddess of dreams.

Mellen dreams of a tadpole swimming alone in a vast pond. She watches it grow into a frog and move from the pond to land. The frog seems content with the change, but now has new problems; snakes and birds that wish to eat it. The frog asks the spirit of the forest for help to protect itself. In response, the forest spirit uses magic to change the frog's skin, making it appear as bark. "Be still and wait for your moment, or the snakes may find you and eat you."

After the dream, Mellen is woken by some sounds from the other side of the door.

Shubat tells Shimni, Koumiss, and Gin that he's content as leader of the Doseovian Army and that one of them can have Mellen as their bride. She must accept one of them, Shubat doesn't give another choice.

Koumiss and Shimni both decide to take the direct approach and flirt heavy-handedly with Mellen while Gin tries to win her over with a classic: dinner and dancing.
