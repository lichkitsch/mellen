Mellen is a kirin, captured by a nomadic tribe (the Wustrolari) and given as a gift to Sartak, the emperor of Doseovia, in exchange for safe passage through Doseovian territory. Kirin are prized magical beings, portents of the rise and fall of powerful figures.

Sartak is already married to Cibreka and has three sons and a daughter, so he gives Mellen to Shubat, the eldest son who has not yet taken a wife.

Shubat is commander of the Doseovian army and in love with his right-hand man, Narin. As he is gay and not interested in a wife, Shubat lets his siblings fight over Mellen after giving her a new, Doseovian name: Midori.

The three siblings, Shimni, Koumiss, and Gin, all have different tactics for winning Mellen as their wife: Shimni and Koumiss take a more direct approach and try to bed Mellen first, while Gin tries to 'woo' her with elaborate gifts.

Among Gin's gifts for Mellen is a sword, a rapier infused with magical obsidian. The rapier is a basic example of Doseovian weaponry; it is their ability to craft and infuse weapons that gave them power and influence.
